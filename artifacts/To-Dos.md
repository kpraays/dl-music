### To-Dos
[Meetings: Every Thursday]
- Now we know that the preprocess.py and train.py from (ddsp pytorch)[https://github.com/acids-ircam/ddsp_pytorch] works.
    - We need:
      - python38
      - replace sr fft in preprocess.py and core.py under ddsp to make it compatible for newer li version.
 
- Next steps:
    - Run preprocess on the smallest dataset (Nsynth) or a smaller option.
    - Eto will upload a working version of the code.
    - Relate the code.py and model.py with the diagram of the model in the paper and point out the explanation for each method in the python files in relation to the model diagram.
